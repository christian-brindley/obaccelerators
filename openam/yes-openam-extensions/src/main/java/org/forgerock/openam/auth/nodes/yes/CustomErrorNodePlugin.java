/**
 * Definition of an <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/am/6/apidocs/org/forgerock/openam/auth/node/api/AbstractNodeAmPlugin.html">AbstractNodeAmPlugin</a>.
 * Implementations can use {@code @Inject} setters to get access to APIs
 * available via Guice dependency injection. For example, if you want to add an SMS service on install, you
 * can add the following setter:
 * <pre><code>
 * {@code @Inject}
 * public void setPluginTools(PluginTools tools) {
 *     this.tools = tools;
 * }
 * </code></pre>
 * So that you can use the addSmsService api to load your schema XML for example.
 * PluginTools javadoc may be found
 * <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/am/6/apidocs/org/forgerock/openam/plugins/PluginTools.html#addSmsService-java.io.InputStream-">here</a>
 * <p>
 *     It can be assumed that when running, implementations of this class will be singleton instances.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     It should <i>not</i> be expected that the runtime singleton instances will be the instances on which
 *     {@link #onAmUpgrade(String, String)} will be called. Guice-injected properties will also <i>not</i> be populated
 *     during that method call.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     Plugins should <i>not</i> use the {@code ShutdownManager}/{@code ShutdownListener} API for handling shutdown, as
 *     the order of calling those listeners is not deterministic. The {@link #onShutdown()} method for all plugins will
 *     be called in the reverse order from the order that {@link #onStartup()} was called, with dependent plugins being
 *     notified after their dependencies for startup, and before them for shutdown.
 * </p>
